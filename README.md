# Python Expense Tracker ðŸ“Š

This project is a simple Expense Tracker, that allows multiple users to add, remove or view any expenses they had. At the moment, I'm working on some other functionalities, so that the program looks more complete.

## Objectives

My objective for this project was to recall my Python knowledge. While I was advancing more and more, I understood that it was better to implement a database to store all the users and expenses for this project, so I began my SQL learning journey. Also, for the GUI, I had to learn new libraries, such as custom tkinter and tkinter.
